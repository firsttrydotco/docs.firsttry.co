description: "Our mission is to help developers grow their mobile apps from scratch. Most content about user acquisition on the internet is too complex for people who never ran user acquisition campaigns before. If you're just starting out with Meta Ads, TikTok Ads, Google Ads, MMPs, Attribution, SDKs, SKAdNetwork... etc and feel lost trying to understand all that mess, then you're at the right place."

## Get Started

Here, you'll find docs and guides that will help you launch campaigns fast, without having to spend hours in Ad Network's or MMP's documentation sections.

These documentations and guides are open source. I will update them if anything changes. The changelog of each doc is available on Github.\
